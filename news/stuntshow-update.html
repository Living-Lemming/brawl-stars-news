Balance changes

Buffs

Bibi
Bibi saw a bit of resurgence in Payload, but that&#039;s about it. Increasing some of her stats should make her a viable pick in more maps and comps
Base HP increased from 4200 to 4400
Base damage increased from 1300 to 1400
Bo
While we want to make more changes for Bo in the future, the first basic step is increasing his projectile speed to make his shots lightly easier to hit.
Projectile speed on basic attack increased about 7%
Griff
Griff feels quite bad to play without keep the change, and it&#039;s the obvious choice. Tuning it down, but increasing base unload should allow for players to have a more interesting decisions when choosing what Star Power to bring, and also make him feel better without the Star Power.
Keep the change: 35→ 25% increased speed
Increased baseline unloads by 50ms. Griff can now unload his ammo faster without the Star Power. With the Star Power, it’s the same as before
Business Resilience: 10→ 15% missing health
Lou
The removal of Siege has melted Lou’s dreams of glory. Making Supercool baseline was a good first move, but also changing Hypothermia’s mechanics was needed for the Star Power to be able to compete. This should not only help Lou at all power levels, but also make the Star Power choice interesting
Supercool is now a baseline ability, but at a 90% effectiveness.
New Supercool increases freezing by 33%, a net 20% gain from old values.
New Hypothermia Star Power decreases the enemy’s damage the more frozen they are. Can go up to 50%.
Squeak
Squeaks gadgets were about as useful as a chewed up dog toy. Now both of them provides some benefit and should provide more options based on the strategy you want to use with Squeak
Windup now also increases the damage of the next attack by 50%
Residue now lasts 5 seconds longer (15→ 20s), also leaves a slowing zone in addition to giving vision

Nerfs

Spike 
Spike has been very versatile for a long period of time, and a big reason for this is his Life Plant Gadget which holds way too much value and nullifies a lot of Brawlers. Reducing the HP significantly allows more Brawlers to take him on

Life Plant: HP reduced from 3500 to 1750Byron 
Byron has flown under the radar for a while without changes, and has crept up in power slowly due to the meta fitting him very well. While he is not out of line, his super was too easy to get, so now byrons have to work a bit harder to get there.
Reduced Super charge from 3 to 4 basic attacksFang 
No matter the kicking and screaming, Fang has to be toned down. His team wipe potential is unparallelled, combined with SP resetting his super on pet kills AND the stun, he has been a force to be reckoned with. He is now more vulnerable when he dives in, and also does not have the upfront burst to the same degree.

Base HP reduced from 4500 to 4300
Super damage reduced from 1200 to 1000
Roundhouse Kick stun duration reduced from 1s to 0,5s
Fresh Kicks no longer resets his super on pet killsEve 
Eve has been extremely strong, even after the range nerf. While her second SP is problematic, she&#039;s also very strong without it. Hitting her across the board should make her much more in line of where she needs to be

Projectile speed decreased from 3700 to 3500
Base HP decreased from 3000 to 2900
Base damage decreased from 400 to 370Gale 
Gale has also seen better times as of late, largely thanks to Fang being strong (and gale being a very good counter), but also because blustery blow allowed for chain stunning other Brawlers at times. Tuning down the stun duration slightly will make sure that other Brawlers will have time to fight back.
Blustery Blow stun duration reduced from 1.5s to 1.25s (shown as 1.3 in-game due to rounding)Reworked

Surge 
So as we theorized new Gadgets, we realized that nothing we can make could compete with teleport, and playing Surge without teleport feels really bad. Not wanting to have a Brawler to rely on a Gadget to be viable, reworking Surge’s entire kit felt like the right option for us. He should now feel better at all levels of play, and the Gadgets should provide a very interesting choice for players
Teleport Gadget removed
Now he can also jump a short distance when using his Super
Gadget 1 - Power Surge - Increases surges upgrade level by 2 for 10 seconds
Gadget 2 - Power Shield - From the next incoming hit within 5 seconds, Surge consumes 80% of the damage and uses the energy to reload 3 ammoResistance Gear
The Resistance Gear now has changed to Vision Gear. 
It reveals opponents for x seconds after dealing damage to them

New Brawlers

Balance changes

Buffs

Bibi
Bibi saw a bit of resurgence in Payload, but that&#039;s about it. Increasing some of her stats should make her a viable pick in more maps and comps
Base HP increased from 4200 to 4400
Base damage increased from 1300 to 1400
Bo
While we want to make more changes for Bo in the future, the first basic step is increasing his projectile speed to make his shots lightly easier to hit.
Projectile speed on basic attack increased about 7%
Griff
Griff feels quite bad to play without keep the change, and it&#039;s the obvious choice. Tuning it down, but increasing base unload should allow for players to have a more interesting decisions when choosing what Star Power to bring, and also make him feel better without the Star Power.
Keep the change: 35→ 25% increased speed
Increased baseline unloads by 50ms. Griff can now unload his ammo faster without the Star Power. With the Star Power, it’s the same as before
Business Resilience: 10→ 15% missing health
Lou
The removal of Siege has melted Lou’s dreams of glory. Making Supercool baseline was a good first move, but also changing Hypothermia’s mechanics was needed for the Star Power to be able to compete. This should not only help Lou at all power levels, but also make the Star Power choice interesting
Supercool is now a baseline ability, but at a 90% effectiveness.
New Supercool increases freezing by 33%, a net 20% gain from old values.
New Hypothermia Star Power decreases the enemy’s damage the more frozen they are. Can go up to 50%.
Squeak
Squeaks gadgets were about as useful as a chewed up dog toy. Now both of them provides some benefit and should provide more options based on the strategy you want to use with Squeak
Windup now also increases the damage of the next attack by 50%
Residue now lasts 5 seconds longer (15→ 20s), also leaves a slowing zone in addition to giving vision

Nerfs

Spike 
Spike has been very versatile for a long period of time, and a big reason for this is his Life Plant Gadget which holds way too much value and nullifies a lot of Brawlers. Reducing the HP significantly allows more Brawlers to take him on

Life Plant: HP reduced from 3500 to 1750Byron 
Byron has flown under the radar for a while without changes, and has crept up in power slowly due to the meta fitting him very well. While he is not out of line, his super was too easy to get, so now byrons have to work a bit harder to get there.
Reduced Super charge from 3 to 4 basic attacksFang 
No matter the kicking and screaming, Fang has to be toned down. His team wipe potential is unparallelled, combined with SP resetting his super on pet kills AND the stun, he has been a force to be reckoned with. He is now more vulnerable when he dives in, and also does not have the upfront burst to the same degree.

Base HP reduced from 4500 to 4300
Super damage reduced from 1200 to 1000
Roundhouse Kick stun duration reduced from 1s to 0,5s
Fresh Kicks no longer resets his super on pet killsEve 
Eve has been extremely strong, even after the range nerf. While her second SP is problematic, she&#039;s also very strong without it. Hitting her across the board should make her much more in line of where she needs to be

Projectile speed decreased from 3700 to 3500
Base HP decreased from 3000 to 2900
Base damage decreased from 400 to 370Gale 
Gale has also seen better times as of late, largely thanks to Fang being strong (and gale being a very good counter), but also because blustery blow allowed for chain stunning other Brawlers at times. Tuning down the stun duration slightly will make sure that other Brawlers will have time to fight back.
Blustery Blow stun duration reduced from 1.5s to 1.25s (shown as 1.3 in-game due to rounding)Reworked

Surge 
So as we theorized new Gadgets, we realized that nothing we can make could compete with teleport, and playing Surge without teleport feels really bad. Not wanting to have a Brawler to rely on a Gadget to be viable, reworking Surge’s entire kit felt like the right option for us. He should now feel better at all levels of play, and the Gadgets should provide a very interesting choice for players
Teleport Gadget removed
Now he can also jump a short distance when using his Super
Gadget 1 - Power Surge - Increases surges upgrade level by 2 for 10 seconds
Gadget 2 - Power Shield - From the next incoming hit within 5 seconds, Surge consumes 80% of the damage and uses the energy to reload 3 ammoResistance Gear
The Resistance Gear now has changed to Vision Gear. 
It reveals opponents for x seconds after dealing damage to them

<strong>Balance changes</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Buffs</strong>
</p>
<ul><li>Bibi
Bibi saw a bit of resurgence in Payload, but that's about it. Increasing some of her stats should make her a viable pick in more maps and comps
<ul><li>Base HP increased from 4200 to 4400
</li><li>Base damage increased from 1300 to 1400
</li></ul></li><li>Bo
While we want to make more changes for Bo in the future, the first basic step is increasing his projectile speed to make his shots lightly easier to hit.
<ul><li>Projectile speed on basic attack increased about 7%
</li></ul></li><li>Griff
Griff feels quite bad to play without keep the change, and it's the obvious choice. Tuning it down, but increasing base unload should allow for players to have a more interesting decisions when choosing what Star Power to bring, and also make him feel better without the Star Power.
<ul><li>Keep the change: 35→ 25% increased speed
</li><li>Increased baseline unloads by 50ms. Griff can now unload his ammo faster without the Star Power. With the Star Power, it’s the same as before
</li><li>Business Resilience: 10→ 15% missing health
</li></ul></li><li>Lou
The removal of Siege has melted Lou’s dreams of glory. Making Supercool baseline was a good first move, but also changing Hypothermia’s mechanics was needed for the Star Power to be able to compete. This should not only help Lou at all power levels, but also make the Star Power choice interesting
<ul><li>Supercool is now a baseline ability, but at a 90% effectiveness.
</li><li>New Supercool increases freezing by 33%, a net 20% gain from old values.
</li><li>New Hypothermia Star Power decreases the enemy’s damage the more frozen they are. Can go up to 50%.
</li></ul></li><li>Squeak
Squeaks gadgets were about as useful as a chewed up dog toy. Now both of them provides some benefit and should provide more options based on the strategy you want to use with Squeak
<ul><li>Windup now also increases the damage of the next attack by 50%
</li><li>Residue now lasts 5 seconds longer (15→ 20s), also leaves a slowing zone in addition to giving vision
</li></ul></li></ul><p><br /></p>
<p><strong>Nerfs</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Spike</strong> </p>
<p>Spike has been very versatile for a long period of time, and a big reason for this is his Life Plant Gadget which holds way too much value and nullifies a lot of Brawlers. Reducing the HP significantly allows more Brawlers to take him on
</p>
<ul><li>Life Plant: HP reduced from 3500 to 1750</li></ul><p><strong>Byron</strong> </p>
<p>Byron has flown under the radar for a while without changes, and has crept up in power slowly due to the meta fitting him very well. While he is not out of line, his super was too easy to get, so now byrons have to work a bit harder to get there.</p>
<ul><li>Reduced Super charge from 3 to 4 basic attacks</li></ul><p><strong>Fang</strong> </p>
<p>No matter the kicking and screaming, Fang has to be toned down. His team wipe potential is unparallelled, combined with SP resetting his super on pet kills AND the stun, he has been a force to be reckoned with. He is now more vulnerable when he dives in, and also does not have the upfront burst to the same degree.
</p>
<ul><li>Base HP reduced from 4500 to 4300
</li><li>Super damage reduced from 1200 to 1000
</li><li>Roundhouse Kick stun duration reduced from 1s to 0,5s
</li><li>Fresh Kicks no longer resets his super on pet kills</li></ul><p><strong>Eve</strong> </p>
<p>Eve has been extremely strong, even after the range nerf. While her second SP is problematic, she's also very strong without it. Hitting her across the board should make her much more in line of where she needs to be
</p>
<ul><li>Projectile speed decreased from 3700 to 3500
</li><li>Base HP decreased from 3000 to 2900
</li><li>Base damage decreased from 400 to 370</li></ul><p><strong>Gale</strong> </p>
<p>Gale has also seen better times as of late, largely thanks to Fang being strong (and gale being a very good counter), but also because blustery blow allowed for chain stunning other Brawlers at times. Tuning down the stun duration slightly will make sure that other Brawlers will have time to fight back.</p>
<ul><li>Blustery Blow stun duration reduced from 1.5s to 1.25s (shown as 1.3 in-game due to rounding)</li></ul><p><strong>Reworked</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Surge</strong> </p>
<p>So as we theorized new Gadgets, we realized that nothing we can make could compete with teleport, and playing Surge without teleport feels really bad. Not wanting to have a Brawler to rely on a Gadget to be viable, reworking Surge’s entire kit felt like the right option for us. He should now feel better at all levels of play, and the Gadgets should provide a very interesting choice for players</p>
<ul><li>Teleport Gadget removed
</li><li>Now he can also jump a short distance when using his Super
</li><li>Gadget 1 - Power Surge - Increases surges upgrade level by 2 for 10 seconds
</li><li>Gadget 2 - Power Shield - From the next incoming hit within 5 seconds, Surge consumes 80% of the damage and uses the energy to reload 3 ammo</li></ul><p><strong>Resistance Gear</strong></p>
<ul><li>The Resistance Gear now has changed to Vision Gear. 
</li><li>It reveals opponents for x seconds after dealing damage to them</li></ul><p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong><br /></p>
<ul><li>Golden Week
</li><li>Crash Test - Reward: Spray </li><li>Unthemed Challenge - Reward: Spray </li></ul><p><strong>Quests</strong>
</p>
<ul><li>Quest rerolls
<ul><li>After rerolling you can’t get the same Brawler/Game mode quest or same criteria (heal/damage/win…)
</li><li>The reward will be equivalent to the discarded quest
</li><li>Not usable for special quests, only for seasonal and daily quests
</li><li>Brawl Pass gives 2 additional rerolls/week (from 1 to 3!)
</li><li>Refreshes weekly
</li></ul></li><li>New Quest Types

</li></ul><p><strong><br /></strong></p>
