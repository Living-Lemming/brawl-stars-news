### Making The Website
Well we first have to start by making a website for the news to be hosted

* This method is 100% free with no ads or anything like it.

1. So step 1. would be to go to [replit.com](https://www.replit.com/)

2. Create an account if you havent already.

3. Create a new repl in replit

4. The repl settings should look like this:

![ReplSettings](https://github.com/brownmouse10/brawl-stars-news/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202022-08-20%20at%2020.28.01.png)

<i>(You can name your repl whatever you want XD)</i>

5. Delete script.js and style.css

6. Paste the contents of [index.html](https://github.com/brownmouse10/brawl-stars-news/blob/main/index.html) into the index.html that you see on the top left

7. Download the latest github repo zip and upload all of its contents except index.html (because we just replaced the replit ones contents, remember?)

8. Make sure everything is working when you click "run"

9. Save your link, you'll need it later. my one was here:

![ReplLink](https://github.com/brownmouse10/brawl-stars-news/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202022-08-20%20at%2020.42.14.png)

### Replacing the links

1. Go to locales.csv:
   
   - on iOS this path is: [name].ipa/[name].app/res/csv_logic/locales.csv

   - on Android this path is: [name].apk/assets/csv_logic/locales.csv

2. Find the row EN (or a different language if your server prefers a different one)

3. Scroll all the way until you see the collumns with links

4. Find Laserbox Url to change the news

5. Paste the link you saved earlier

6. Repackage your apk/ipa and go into the game, you should see it has changed

There are many more links you could change; Play around with them :)
